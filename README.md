Govt Funding Impact on Homelessness
Research Question ideas: 
Version 1: “Does HUD CoC funding reduce homelessness”
Version 2: “What is the marginal effect of CoC funding per capita on Point in Time homelessness counts? “

Empirical Strategy: Test whether variation in CoC funding levels is associated with reduced community-level homelessness rates, controlling for poverty, median rent, substance abuse, and mental health services access. I will select 3 to 5 counties, across a handful of years, depending on available data. For example, 2015-2023 would offer a pre/post COVID timeframe.  Note, not all ‘Counties’ align with CoCs so I would select CoCs that best fit county geographics.  
 
DV = Homelessness rate per 10,000 population

IVs: HUD funding (main IV), poverty rate, median rent, (I’d like to use substance abuse and mental health access, but I’m not sure where to get data yet.)  I will also need to address funding sources outside of HUD that may impact a CoC’s effectiveness.

Data Sources: 

IV HUD Funding*:  (*note: pending current CR, website will shut down if govt is shut down.) Under normal circumstances, HUD funding data is open source and available.  HUD also has a cross walk “CoC to County Crosswalk” so I can align the data with the poverty and rent data that is pulled from data.census.gov. 

IV Poverty Rate = %:  ACS S1701, data provides a county, year, and percentage. 
Example: 18.1% https://data.census.gov/profile/Tucson_city,_Arizona?g=160XX00US0477000

IV Median Rent = $$:  ACS B25064, data provides county, year, and Median Gross Rent in $$ 

My final data set would be ‘panel data’, multiple CoCs across multiple years
